</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday, George Dialynas is now Dr. George Dialynas! Congratulations to
George! He delivered very nice experimental and theoretical work on the control
of bicycles where he's added some very important findings to push forward
single track vehicle control. He also developed unique equipment that we are
excited to use in the future in the lab. He has kindly shared his defense on
Youtube. This is a nice opportunity to see a Dutch PhD defense. The defense
provides a special time for the candidate to defend his findings and be awarded
his new degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first video is George's presentation followed by the defense portion:&lt;/p&gt;

at 12:30 CEST.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Georgios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be defending my Ph.D. dissertation titled &amp;quot;An experimental approach
into the quantification of steering and balance behaviour of bicyclists&amp;quot; on
Tuesday 15th September 2020 at 12.30-13:30 h in the Senaatszaal of the TU
Delft Aula. Prior to the defense, at  12.00 h, I will give a brief
presentation about my research. I invite my family and friends to join the
event via: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1012404512534541"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1012404512534541&lt;/a&gt; (I decided FB
since there are no time or participants limitations for the mobile version)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thesis Aim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this thesis is to derive bicycle rider control models, based on
experimental data, that mimic the rider in his balance control task at
various forward speeds. These rider control models can help to understand
bicycle falls and crashes, predict cyclist motions necessary for vehicle to
vehicle safety systems, and can guide towards the design of a bicycle with
active balance control. You can find the softcopy of my thesis here:

</summary><content type="html">&lt;img alt="TU Delft Logo" class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/tudelft-logo.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that I have accepted a position as an Assistant
Professor in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/about/departments/biomechanical-engineering/"&gt;Biomechanical Engineering Department&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/"&gt;Mechanical,
Maritime, and Materials Engineering (3mE) Faculty&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl"&gt;Delft University of
Technology&lt;/a&gt; where I will join the Biomechatronics &amp;amp; Human-Machine Control
group. At TU Delft I will be leading a research laboratory and effort focusing
on bicycle engineering and related technologies. I will be teaching courses in
dynamics, multibody dynamics, and computational engineering to compliment this
effort and support the students in the department and faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this means that the Laboratorium for Marvelous Mechanical Motum will be
moving with me to the Netherlands. Over the next few years the lab will be
reimagined as it merges with the existing TU Delft &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/"&gt;Bicycle Dynamics Lab&lt;/a&gt;. The
primary initial topics of research will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data driven vehicle and biomechanical modeling of the bicycle-rider system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data driven manual control characterization and identification in bicycle
balance and navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and augmented/autonomous control for improvements in bicycling safety
and handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of the next generation of bicycle designs for improvements to
transportation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application of vehicle dynamics to influence transportation infrastructure
design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance and safety improvements in the sport of cycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are described more in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/application-materials/blob/gh-pages/2019/tudelft/research-statement.pdf"&gt;research statement&lt;/a&gt; I developed for my
application and presented in the slides from the job talk below:&lt;/p&gt;

mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start the new position on August 1st, 2020; so look for changes and new
announcements as I ramp up activity. I'll soon be looking for TU Delft MSc
students for various projects and will be reaching out to researchers,
companies, and organizations in Europe to develop new collaborations. Feel free
to contact me if you are interested in working with me and the new lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to miss UC Davis. I've been here for the vast majority of the last
15 years and have learned so much from the faculty, students, and colleagues.
It is a bittersweet departure, but an exciting new adventure awaits!&lt;/p&gt;

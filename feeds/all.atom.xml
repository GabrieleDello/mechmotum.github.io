&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small scale farmers use human-powered water pumps in rural areas to increase
crop yields beyond subsistence levels. Different designs utilize various
biomechanical motions. One of the most popular and proven designs for
human-powered water pumps is the treadle pump, which is operated via a stepping
motion (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Treadle Example." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/treadle-example.jpg" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. A user ‚Äútreadles‚Äù on the Money Maker treadle pump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treadle pump is an inexpensive and portable irrigation tool. According to
International Development Enterprises (IDE), treadle pumps helped farmers in
Bangladesh increase their income by an average of $100 a year. This increase in
profit allowed farmers to invest in larger, more expensive irrigation machines
that further increased crop yields and helped create financial stability
&lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#polak" id="id1"&gt;[Polak]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype pedal-powered centrifugal water pump was tested by Abe McKay during
his Master‚Äôs studies &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#mckay" id="id2"&gt;[McKay]&lt;/a&gt;. Mckay‚Äôs tests suggested that this pump‚Äôs
efficiency was comparable to that of the commercially available Xylem and Money
Maker treadle pumps. Detailed efficiency data for these treadle pumps are not
available and thus an accurate comparison could not be made until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our experiment, we gathered efficiency data from the Xylem and Money Maker
treadle pumps and compared them to McKay‚Äôs data on the prototype Buffalo pump.
By comparing the efficiency of the Buffalo pump to the commercially available
Xylem and Money Maker pumps, we can evaluate the prototype‚Äôs potential for
success as a low cost tool for small scale irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="methods"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKay had conducted an efficiency test with the centrifugal pump so our goal
was to conduct a similar test with our treadle pumps in order to produce data
that could be compared. We conducted fifteen tests, with three replicates at
each pressure head between 1 and 5 meters. We pumped 20 liters of water for
each test. We measured time using a photoresistor that was covered and
uncovered (on/off) to record the beginning and end of each test. The DAQ
apparatus including photoresistor circuit, sensor wires, and LabJack is shown
in Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="DAQ Setup." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/daq-setup.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. The LabJack was kept dry and out of danger behind the treadle pump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force sensors were designed using steel plates and two 200 kg rated load cells.
The load cells were mounted between steel plates and then mounted on the
treadle pump lever arms with U-bolts. We calibrated the force sensor using
Olympic weights and a balance scale for reference. The power meter apparatus
consisting of the force sensors and angular rate gyro are shown below in Figure
3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Treadle Pump Setup." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/treadle-pump-setup.jpg" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. The Xylem treadle pump with force sensor and angular rate gyro attached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measure force and angular rate using the force sensors and the angular rate
gyro respectively. Using our force measurements, we were able to calculate
torque using the equation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Torque Equation." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/torque-equation.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; is the force in Newtons applied to the lever arm perpendicular
to the arm. The radius &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is the distance from the point of applied
force to the lever arm‚Äôs center of rotation. Using torque and angular rate
measurements from the angular rate gyro, power in watts is calculated using the
equation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Power Equation." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/power-equation.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where torque ùõï is in Newton-meters and angular velocity ùõö is in
radians per second. Time required to fill the 20 liter bucket was measured and
used to calculate flow rate. Hydraulic power could then be calculated using the
equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hydraulic Power." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/hydraulic-power.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying for water, where density equals 1 kilogram per liter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Simplified Hyrdualic Power." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/simplified-hydraulic-power.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; is measured in liters per second, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt; is 9.81 meters per
second squared, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt; is vertical pressure head measured in meters.
Efficiency can be calculated using the equation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Power Efficiency." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/efficiency.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazen efficiency is determined by calculating the friction head loss using the
Hazen-Williams equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hazen-Williams Head Loss Equation." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/hazen-williams-head-loss-equation.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic power is adjusted using this estimated friction head. A Hazen
efficiency can then determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each test began with one person priming the pump in order to achieve consistent
water flow. The collector would deliver the pumped water into an overflow
bucket until the experiment began. At the start of the experiment the treadler
would remove a piece of paper covering the photoresistor. Simultaneously, the
collector would transfer the outlet hose to the 20 L metered collection bucket.
During the data collection, the treadler would attempt to maintain an average
of 100 Watts. This was done by feel only and therefore resulted in some
deviation from the target power. The experiment ended when the collector
signaled to the treadler that 20 L was reached, at which point the
photoresistor was covered and the data collection complete. The data was
collected via a MATLAB program and saved after each trial. 15 trials were
completed: three at each meter interval between 1 and 5 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures 4-8 above show the calculated efficiencies for each pump at
different pressure heads across all trials. The average efficiencies are
graphed in figure 9 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Average Efficiency." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/average-efficiency.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 9 shows the efficiency trends across different pressure heads for each
pump. The average efficiency was found by finding the mean across the three
trial tests at each pressure head. The effect that the variation in power may
have had on efficiency was assumed to be negligible. The trendlines and
corresponding equations are shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="discussion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a variation in average power within each testing group that must be
acknowledged. Because the average power for each testing group was not held
constant, we must consider the relationship between power and efficiency. When
the trendlines for each testing group are observed, our data does not suggest a
strong relationship between average power and efficiency within a given
pressure head. More data points and a dedicated testing procedure would help
validate this claim, but the observed results are enough to make the assumption
that the effect of any hypothetical correlation is negligible given the range
over which average power varied during our tests. Therefore, the average
efficiencies can be compared between pumps where pressure head is held constant
despite fluctuating average power measurements across trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 9 shows the average efficiencies for each pump at various pressure
heads. The centrifugal Buffalo pump has a negatively sloped trendline whereas
the treadle pumps have positively sloped trendlines when observed between our
range of pressure heads. The Xylem pump surpasses the efficiency of the Buffalo
pump around 4.5 meters pressure head. The Money Maker pump can be predicted to
surpass the efficiency of the Buffalo pump at around 5.5 meters pressure head.
The Xylem and Money Maker pumps share a similar relationship between increased
pressure head and increased efficiency. There is a difference in slope between
the two trendlines of 0.54. Due to shared mechanical properties, all
treadle-type pumps most likely produce similarly sloped trendlines. The
centrifugal Buffalo pump is a completely different design, and thus its
efficiency can be predicted along a completely different trendline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buffalo pump is determined to be 21% (ùõî = 6.7%) more efficient at 1
meter pressure head than the Xylem pump, and 32% (ùõî = 4.9%) more
efficient at the same head when compared to the Money Maker. At 2 meters
pressure head, the Buffalo pump was 17.0% (ùõî = 2.9%) and 24.7% (ùõî =
2.4%) more efficient than the Xylem and Money Maker respectively. At 3 meters
head, it was 16.3% (ùõî = 3.8%) and 26% (ùõî = 4.1%) more efficient
respectively. At 4 meters, the differences decreased to 2.2% (ùõî = 4.6%)
and 9.7% (ùõî = 4.6%). At 5 meters the Xylem pump was 6.8% (ùõî = 4.9%)
more efficient than the Buffalo pump and the Money Maker was only 2% (ùõî =
3.7%) less efficient than the Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the correlation between power and efficiency can be determined, these
conclusions include an error assumed to be negligible. It is within the best
interest of further research to try and describe this correlation, which may
appear something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Power Efficiency Correlation." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/power-efficiency-correlation.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For low C values (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1), our assumption can be considered valid. Our current
assumption is that C=0, where efficiency is not a function of power. It would
also be beneficial to direct further research at determining the range of
pressure heads most frequently encountered in real world irrigation situations.
This information will be critical in determining which human powered water pump
is the most efficient for its given application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research finds that the Buffalo pump is more efficient than the Xylem
treadle pump up to 4.5 meters pressure head, and the Money Maker up to 5.5
meters pressure head. The efficiency advantage of one type of pump over another
will depend largely on pressure head. Figure 9 shows the efficiency trends
between two treadle style pumps and a centrifugal-type water pump.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="introduction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to design and implement a control system for an
instrumented ebike used in bicycle handling experimentation. To achieve this, a
basic unity feedback control architecture (Figure 1) is employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Control Architecture." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-01.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Control architecture where e is the error between the actual
speed v of the ebike and the desired speed, vd, and V is the DC input
voltage to the ebike plant model. Gc and Gp represent the controller and
plant model respectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the controller is to track a setpoint speed, within +/- 0.10 m/s,
set by the rider.  To achieve this, a PID controller was tuned using MATLAB‚Äôs
Control System Toolbox. The ebike plant model was derived using first
principles and grey box system identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="modeling-the-ebike-from-first-principles"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modeling the eBike From First Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of the ebike powertrain and the vehicle itself can be modeled from
first principles. The powertrain of the ebike consists of a standard ebike
conversion kit motor controller and a brushless 3 phase direct drive induction
motor mounted to the rear hub of the bike. A simple diagram of the ebike
drivetrain is shown below in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Ebike Drivetrain Diagram." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-02.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Diagram of the drivetrain circuit and dynamics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 2, the induction motor is approximated by a model of a DC motor
circuit with resistance &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, inductance &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(L\)&lt;/span&gt; and back emf
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(V_b\)&lt;/span&gt;. The torques &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_m\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_p\)&lt;/span&gt; acting on the motor shaft
correspond to motor torque and wheel propulsion torque respectively. The
rotational dynamics of the drivetrain are defined by Euler‚Äôs rotation equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple equation of motion for the bicycle, modeled as a point mass, is
derived using Newton‚Äôs 2nd Law of Motion in the horizontal direction &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#wilson" id="id1"&gt;[Wilson]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Free Body Diagram of Bicycle." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-03.jpg" style="width: 20%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Free body diagram of the bicycle modeled as a point mass. Fa, Fr
and Fp are the aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance and propulsive forces
respectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the vehicle and drivetrain dynamics of the ebike can be shown in a
state space representation with state variables &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;
as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="State Space Representation of the eBike." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-04.jpg" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the state space representation, a transfer function from input DC voltage
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(V\)&lt;/span&gt; to output speed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; is formed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Plant Model Transfer Function." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-05.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plant model is a second order transfer function relating an applied DC
voltage input to the ebike‚Äôs motor controller to the output speed of the ebike.
This model represents an approximation of the true plant model of the ebike. To
get a more accurate plant model, a grey box system identification procedure
based on measured time response data from the ebike was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performing-system-identification-from-experimental-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performing System Identification From Experimental Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin the process of system identification, the values of the ebike
drivetrain model parameters and bicycle drag and tire rolling resistance
coefficients were initialized using reasonable approximations found from
internet searches, previous knowledge of the instrumented ebike &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#moore" id="id2"&gt;[Moore]&lt;/a&gt; and
textbook resources &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="#wilson" id="id3"&gt;[Wilson]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MATLAB, a nonlinear least-squares solver was used to optimize the constants
in the derived plant model of the ebike to match a speed time response measured
from the instrumented ebike. Figure 4, below, shows the curve fitting result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 shows that the plant model of ebike was reasonably identified using
the least-squares curve fitting method. The resulting ebike plant model is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Identified Plant Model." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-07.jpg" style="width: 90%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="controller-design-in-matlab"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Controller Design in MATLAB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the plant model of the ebike identified, a PID controller (kp = 68.5, ki =
106, kd = 1.44) was tuned for zero steady state error and reasonable transient
behavior using MATLAB‚Äôs Control System Toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closed loop step response (Figure 5) shows that the controller meets the
design goals with zero steady state error, a settling time of 1.56s, and an
overshoot percentage of 10.45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Closed Loop System Step Response." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-08.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Closed Loop System Step Response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evaluation-of-controller-robustness"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evaluation of Controller Robustness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MATLAB‚Äôs Robust Control Toolbox was used to test the robustness of the closed
loop system with regards to uncertainties in the coefficients of the identified
ebike plant model. The constants in the derived ebike plant model were lumped
together forming the following simplified plant model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Simplified Plant Model." class="align-center" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-09.jpg" style="width: 90%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constants &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; in the above
transfer function were defined in MATLAB as real-uncertain parameters with
varying percentage based uncertainties about their nominal values. The nominal
values of each coefficient were taken from the result of the system
identification step of the controller design process.  Figure 6, below, shows
the nominal closed loop and open loop system step response with 20 random
samples of the uncertain plant model defined by the uncertain coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Uncertain Step Response." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bike-speed-control-10.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. Step response of the nominal closed loop system with 20 random
samples of the uncertain closed loop step response superimposed on the
plot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 shows that the closed loop system is reasonably robust despite
uncertainty in the plant model. Having this robustness in the control system
means that small changes in the dynamics of the ebike will not cause the
controller to have undesirable performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple PID controller used in a unity feedback control architecture was
designed to reduce the steady state error and improve the transient performance
of the speed time response of an instrumented ebike. Using grey box system
identification, the plant model of the ebike was identified and used in the
controller design. A PID tuner app was used to tune the controller constants to
achieve zero steady state gain and favorable transient behavior. Finally, the
robustness of the controller was tested by simulating uncertainties in the
closed loop system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the project is to take the continuous time PID controller and
implement it digitally on the instrumented ebike. Stay tuned for part two:
Implementing a PID Controller on an Instrumented Ebike.&lt;/p&gt;

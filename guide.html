<p>This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it. Discuss with the lab any
desires to change any of the guidelines.</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Getting Started</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Join the lab communication channels:<ul>
<li>Ask Jason &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:j.k.moore@tudelft.nl">j.k.moore@tudelft.nl</a>&gt; or Marco &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:M.M.Reijne@tudelft.nl">M.M.Reijne@tudelft.nl</a>&gt; to add
you to the lab <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/mechmotum">email list</a>.</li>
<li>Ask Rado &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl">r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl</a>&gt; to add you to the lab's chat room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send an introduction email to the lab email list: who you are, what you will
work on, etc.</li>
<li>Add your name and portrait to the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/members.html">lab members page</a> by sending a PNG or JPG
300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.</li>
<li>Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
recommendations.</li>
<li>Attend biweekly lab meetings. Ask a lab member for the calendar invite with
the video chat link. Add your ideas and votes for meeting topics to the
google document (ask Marco for permissions to edit).</li>
<li>Send out an AIO (see below) before your regular mentor meetings.</li>
<li>Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
needed). These can be requested from Arend or Jason. Ask for a tour of the
space from a current lab member before you start working there.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="covid-time-lab-rules">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">COVID-Time Lab Rules</a></h2>
<p>Use of the bicycle lab for hands-on project work is allowed as long as 3mE
allows this type of work inside the building. Check with Arend or Jason for the
up-to-date rules if in question. The current lab rules are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/coronavirus/">University rules</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/current/information-coronavirus/">3mE rules</a> apply and
the following rules are in addition to those.</li>
<li>Indicate on the lab <a class="reference external" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=amcwaG9nMnZxaWRxMXI0dGdmdmlzcWEwazhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">reservation calendar</a> when you will be present and how
many people will be present with your reservation. The reservations work on
first come, first serve basis. Talk to your fellow lab members if adjustments
are needed for time conflicts.</li>
<li>No more than 4 people may be in the lab at any given time.</li>
<li>1.5 m distance must be kept between everyone present in the lab.</li>
<li>Wear masks when up and about in the lab. When seated you may remove your
mask.</li>
<li>If you are sick, stay home and get tested.</li>
<li>Take the virus seriously and respect everyone's health needs/wishes. Everyone
should feel comfortable if using the space. Communication is key for this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Communication</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Lab Email List</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum</a></p>
<p class="last">This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Text, Audio, Video Chat Room</dt>
<dd>We host a <a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> server which can be accessed using <a class="reference external" href="https://element.io">https://element.io</a> or
any other supported <a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/">clients</a>. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.</dd>
<dt>Issue Trackers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communication.
This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
repository (in addition to the website issues):</p>
<p class="last"><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io">https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>Quarterly Blog Posts</dt>
<dd>In general, we would like each project to write regular blog posts for the
lab website. These posts should describe updates on project progress and
results. This writing exercise will help build the content for future papers
and theses and provide outreach to the public about our work. It is helpful
to do these on a schedule (quarterly, semi-annually, etc.) so that the get
done. If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll need to select
aspects of the project or work that can be shared. Discuss these things with
your supervisor.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="aio-weekly-emails">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">AIO Weekly Emails</a></h3>
<p>Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to the lab group email list and any
project collaborators each week.</p>
<p>"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,</li>
<li>what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally</li>
<li>what your objectives are for the coming week.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should send it to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:mechmotum@googlegroups.com">mechmotum@googlegroups.com</a> and cc anyone not in the lab
that is involved in your project.</p>
<p>The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with your daily
supervisor, anyone involved in your project outside the lab, and also to share
among the lab members. The latter is important, because many of you may be
solving similar problems and can offer help/tips to other members Doing this
will hopefully certainly start conversations among the group. Some notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.</li>
<li>No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.</li>
<li>The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.</li>
<li>It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
suggestion so everyone can learn.</li>
<li>The AIOs are not a contest. Your supervisor is not collecting these to judge
how much you accomplish, but they do care that you are working, attempting to
make progress, and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had
vacation that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just
note that.</li>
<li>If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
reader to understand the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the PI. It can be before
(we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the issues with
me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post meeting. Some
students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after meeting with the
PI. However you do it, each week the accomplishments should hopefully reflect
the objectives you wrote the previous week.</p>

<div class="section" id="open-science">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Open Science</a></h2>
<p>The default science and engineering practice should be open practices (open
access publications, open source software, open data, accessible and public
sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information public, ask, otherwise
please default to sharing early and often. We do work with organizations that
value or require privacy (human subject data, student protected data,
proprietary company needs). Always check with the involved parties before
sharing when this is the case. This is something that should be discussed at
the beginning of all projects.</p>
<p>TU Delft offers several resources for open science:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<div class="section" id="research-tools-contributions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Research Tools Contributions</a></h3>
<p>Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-website">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Lab Website</a></h2>
<p>The lab website is a <a class="reference external" href="getpelican.com">Pelican</a> based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io">https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io</a></p>
<p>Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-tools">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Software Tools</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="reference-management">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Reference Management</a></h3>
<p>The lab has a shared <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum">mechmotum group</a>. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Version Control</a></h3>
<p>The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/mechmotum">https://gitlab.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum">https://github.com/mechmotum</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.</p>
<p>Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Git lesson</a> is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.</p>

<div class="section" id="lab-space">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Lab Space</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="inventory">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Inventory</a></h3>
<p>There is a common spreadsheet on google drive that lab members should use to
track our non-consumable inventory (tools, devices, expensive stuff,
computers, 3D printing spools in the EDSC, etc). Anytime you buy something add
it to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be accessed at this link:</p>

<div class="section" id="training">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Training</a></h2>
<p>It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.</p>

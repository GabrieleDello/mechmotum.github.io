nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it. Discuss with the lab any
desires to change any of the guidelines.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">The Lab Community</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Join the lab communication channels:<ul>
<li>Ask Jason &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:j.k.moore@tudelft.nl">j.k.moore@tudelft.nl</a>&gt; to add you to the lab <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/mechmotum">email list</a>.</li>
<li>Ask Rado &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl">r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl</a>&gt; to add you to the lab's element/matrix
chat room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send an introduction email to the lab email list: who you are, a bit about
yourself, what you will work on, etc.</li>
<li>Add your name and portrait to the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/members.html">lab members page</a> by sending a PNG or JPG
300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.</li>
<li>Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
recommendations.</li>
<li>Attend biweekly <a class="reference external" href="#laboratory-meetings">lab meetings</a>. Ask a lab member for
the calendar invite with the video chat link. Add your ideas and votes for
meeting topics to the google document (ask Marco for permissions to edit).</li>
<li>Send out an AIO (see below) before your regular mentor meetings if requested
by your supervisors.</li>
<li>Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
needed). These can be requested from Jason. Ask for a tour of the space from
a current lab member before you start working there.</li>
<li>See the <a class="reference external" href="#recommended-reading">recommended reading list</a> below for some
reading materials to get you started.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="msc-general">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">MSc General</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We expect you to take the lead in your project. Your supervisors are here to
advise and guide you, but it is up to you to manage your time, relationships,
work, etc.</li>
<li>BME MSc students now have some new excellent guidance documents with
flowcharts available on the "Master Biomedical Engineering" Brightspace
course under "ALL STUDENTS - Flowcharts &amp; Guidance Docs".</li>
<li>BMD &amp; BME students are encouraged to join the "Graduation Community Program"
for get togethers and workshops on topics to help you move through your MSc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internship">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Internship</a></h3>
<p>After you have found an internship, typically on your own but sometimes through
postings via the lab, here are some things you need to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review the Study Guide explanation of your internship, for example:<ul>
<li>BMD: <a class="reference external" href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456">https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456</a></li>
<li>BME: <a class="reference external" href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534">https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review the internship forms and guidelines (always use up-to-date forms):
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms</a></li>
<li>Fill out the MSc internship initiation form with your project description and
other relevant information. Develop this project idea with your internship
company/org contacts. If you think this aligns with Jason's research
interests or the internship came through the bike lab you can send the form
to Jason and ask him to be your TUD advisor. If he agrees, then you can
obtain his signature on the form and forward it to your respective MSc
coordinator.</li>
<li>Make all of your internship arrangements yourself with the company (travel,
stipend, housing, IP, NDA, etc.). Reach out to your TUD supervisor if you
need help in any of these aspects.</li>
<li>To receive academic credit for your internship at the end you need to write a
report and have it assessed by your TUD internship supervisor. The short report
should contain aspects aligned with those described in this rubric:
<a class="reference external" href="https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf">https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf</a>.
This rubric will not be used to determine your grade, it is simply pass/fail
based on the supervisor's review.</li>
<li>You also need your external internship supervisor to fill out the form
"INTERNSHIP ASSESSMENT FORM FOR EXTERNAL PARTIES" and submit the completed
version to your TUD supervisor.</li>
<li>Note that your TUD supervisor is typically not involved in your internship
other than the signing the initial form and assessing and providing a grade
at the end. The purpose of the internship is for you to get some non-academic
experience in engineering.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="literature-study">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Literature Study</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review the <a class="reference external" href="https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/3ME/Onderwijs/GERELATEERD/Formulieren/Rubric%20MSc%20Literature%20Review.pdf">Literature Study learning objectives and rubric</a></li>
<li>Read "<a class="reference external" href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf">How to read a paper</a>" and "<a class="reference external" href="https://lancaster.libguides.com/engineering/literaturereview">Guide to writing a literature review for Science and Technology students</a>"</li>
<li>If you are a BME student, read the relevant guidance docs found on
Brightspace "Biomedical Engineering Page".</li>
<li>Choose and learn a tool/method to organize your papers and notes (e.g.
Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote, Excel).</li>
<li>The first goal is to read a large quantity of paper abstracts (phase 1 in
"How to Read a Paper") to get a broad sense of what people are researching
about the topics of interest.</li>
<li>The second goal is to formulate a research question(s) that you can likley
answer with the papers you read.</li>
<li>Third goal is to delve deep into papers that are closely related to your
research question, analyze and critique them, and synthesize the knowledge you
obtain from them into a coherent answer to you research question.</li>
<li>Lastly, write up your findings for a technical audience in a way that answers
your research question.</li>
<li>Once you have a first full draft of the literature study, request feedback
from your supervisors. This usually takes a week. Use the feedback to improve
your document and then submit it to your supervisors for their official
assessment and grade.</li>
<li>As you approach the finish of your literature study you should schedule your
colloquium, where you will present the results of your literature study to
your peers and possibly some of your thesis plan.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="msc-thesis">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">MSc Thesis</a></h3>
<p>Basic Steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(CoR based MSc tracks only) Submit MSc initiation form.</li>
<li>Formulate a research question or hypothesis that you'd like address in
consultation with your supervisors (usually in the later portion of your
literature study period).</li>
<li>Develop a written project plan (2-3 pages): research question/aim/goals, your
basic technical approach, timeline, milestones, resources, etc.</li>
<li>Organize a kickoff meeting with all of your supervisors to present your
research project and project plan.</li>
<li>Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.</li>
<li>Present your progress at a midterm meeting with all of your supervisors.</li>
<li>Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.</li>
<li>Send your draft thesis to your supervisors and arrange a Go/No-Go meeting.</li>
<li>Arrange your MSc defense.</li>
<li>Edit your thesis and send the final version to your supervisors two weeks
before the defense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always use up-to-date forms from here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me%E2%80%90student%E2%80%90portal/education/related/student%E2%80%90forms/msc%E2%80%90forms/">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me%E2%80%90student%E2%80%90portal/education/related/student%E2%80%90forms/msc%E2%80%90forms/</a></li>
<li>If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
sensitive information you will need to arrange the "Graduation Agreement at a
Company" that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
here here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/">https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/</a>.
Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.</li>
<li>Read the articles about writing reports and theses in the recommended reading
later in this guide.</li>

<div class="section" id="covid-time-lab-rules">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">COVID-Time Lab Rules</a></h2>
<p>Use of the bicycle lab for hands-on project work is allowed as long as 3mE
allows this type of work inside the building. Check with Jason for the
up-to-date rules if in question. The current lab rules are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/coronavirus/">University rules</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/current/information-coronavirus/">3mE rules</a> apply and
the following rules are in addition to those.</li>
<li>If you are sick, stay home and get tested. Let others you were in contact
with know immediately of possible or confirmed COVID infection to prevent
spread.</li>
<li>Take the virus seriously and respect everyone's health needs/wishes. Everyone
should feel comfortable if using the space. Communication is key for this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Communication</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Lab Email List</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum</a></p>
<p class="last">This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Text, Audio, Video Chat Room</dt>
<dd>We host a <a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> server which can be accessed using <a class="reference external" href="https://element.io">https://element.io</a> or
any other supported <a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/">clients</a>. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.</dd>
<dt>Issue Trackers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communication.
This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
repository (in addition to the website issues):</p>
<p class="last"><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io">https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>Quarterly Blog Posts</dt>
<dd>In general, we would like each project to write regular blog posts for the
lab website. These posts should describe updates on project progress and
results. This writing exercise will help build the content for future papers
and theses and provide outreach to the public about our work. It is helpful
to do these on a schedule (quarterly, semi-annually, etc.) so that the get
done. If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll need to select
aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo the blog post
to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="aio-weekly-emails">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-9">AIO Weekly Emails</a></h3>
<p>Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to their supervisor(s) and any
project collaborators you meet with during your regular meetings.</p>
<p>"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,</li>
<li>what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally</li>
<li>what your objectives are for the coming week.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with your daily supervisor
and anyone involved in your project outside the lab. Some notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.</li>
<li>The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.</li>
<li>No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.</li>
<li>It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
suggestion so everyone can learn and discuss.</li>
<li>The AIOs are not a contest. Your supervisor is not collecting these to judge
how much you accomplish, but they do care that you are working, attempting to
make progress, and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had
vacation that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just
note that.</li>
<li>If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
reader to understand the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the supervisor. It can be
before (we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the
issues with me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post
meeting. Some students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after
meeting with the supervisor. However you do it, each week the accomplishments
should hopefully reflect the objectives you wrote the previous week.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="laboratory-meetings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-10">Laboratory Meetings</a></h2>
<p>We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have a designated person
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.</p>
<p>The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>10-20 minute presentation with Q &amp; A</li>
<li>tutorial</li>
<li>have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)</li>
<li>watch and discuss a video</li>
<li>invite a speaker</li>
<li>play a game</li>
<li>practice your colloquia or conference talks</li>
<li>bicycle-themed stand-up</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.</p>
<p>The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-how-to-mc-lab-meetings.html">MC Guide</a> for
instructions on being the MC.</p>

<div class="section" id="open-science">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">Open Science</a></h2>
<p>The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public ask you supervisor, otherwise please default to sharing early and often.
We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject
data, student protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the
involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that
should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.</p>
<p>TU Delft offers several resources for open science:</p>

<div class="section" id="research-tools-contributions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-14">Research Tools Contributions</a></h3>
<p>Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-website">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-15">Lab Website</a></h2>
<p>The lab website is a <a class="reference external" href="getpelican.com">Pelican</a> based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io">https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io</a></p>
<p>Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.</p>

<div class="section" id="shared-cloud-space">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-17">Shared Cloud Space</a></h3>
<p>We have a directory named "Fietslab Commons" on Google Drive. To access this,
request that it be shared with you by your supervisor. This folder and it's
contents should only be shared with other <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;netid&gt;@g-tudelft.nl&gt;</span></tt> addresses
that are members of the lab. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;netid&gt;@g-tudelft.nl&gt;</span></tt> is also the login
username/email that you will need to use when logging into
<a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com">https://drive.google.com</a>. Please avoid using the "Share" button to share with
non-TUD accounts, until we determine best practices for this. Read and update
the README files present in the Google Drive directories to learn how to use
the space. If you create new directories, add a README file to explain what the
purpose of the folder is. If you want to add large amounts of data (&gt;10 Gb),
inform your supervisor first because there may be a more appropriate long term
storage solution for certain types of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-management">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-18">Reference Management</a></h3>
<p>The lab has a shared <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum">mechmotum group</a>. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-19">Version Control</a></h3>
<p>The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/mechmotum">https://gitlab.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum">https://github.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab">https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.</p>
<p>Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Git lesson</a> is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.</p>
<p><strong>Private repositories</strong> are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-21">Using, removing, loaning equipment &amp; consumables</a></h3>
<p>If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!</p>
<p>If a TU Delft student or staff that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab, find out if anyone is using it (as noted above), and
then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the lab door) with their
name, email, and date before the item leaves the lab. When they return the
item, indicate the return date on the sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member
students should look to the more general shared equipment resources available
in 3mE before borrowing from us and we don't generally loan common things like
screwdrivers and bike pumps but can loan specialized equipment that only we
have.</p>
<p>If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for <strong>more than one day</strong> you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.</p>
<p>If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="purchasing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-22">Purchasing</a></h3>
<p>If the lab needs basic office supplies or computer supplies, a request should
be made to the secretary. Don't purchase these yourself, because they should be
purchased through the university vendors.</p>
<p>If you need some lab supplies or equipment for your project, talk with your
supervisor about it and they can order what you need if there are funds
available.</p>

<p>We have proposed a theoretical lateral handling quality metric for any given
bicycle design based on a corpus of experimental data in aircraft handling
research <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. This project aims to validate this metric directly from
experimental evidence in bicycling maneuvers and tasks. We have developed a
variable stability instrumented bicycle and demonstrated preliminarily that
that there may be correlations between our theoretical metric and the rider's
subjective opinion of the bicycle's handling <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>. Ongoing work includes,
improvements to the experimental apparatus and protocol for a larger scale
validation with arbitrary experimental subjects <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Humans unconsciously utilize a control strategy while standing. Visual,
vestibular, and proprioceptive sensing inform the brain's control strategy
which reacts to internally and environmentally produced perturbations. This is
something humans are very good at but robots are bad at, thus if we can
understand how humans accomplish this we can potentially design robots with
biomimetic controllers. In laboratory settings we can accurately measure body
segment kinematics, muscle activation levels, and ground force reactions during
standing. Given all or subsets of this data collected during externally
perturbed standing, we are interested in developing optimal control theories
and methods of identifying the specific control strategy in use. We have
developed parameter identification methods using direct collocation to identify
the controllers used in simulated standing <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id7">[4]</a>. The general optimal control
and parameter estimation methods used have been formalized in the software,
Opty <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id8">[5]</a>. We are currently developing a small desktop &quot;double pendulum on a
cart&quot; robot to verify and improve the control identification methods. The robot
will allow us to measure the motion during perturbed balancing which is a
result of known programmed control strategies.</p>

<p>Analysis of comprehensive dynamical data during bicycling trips and activities

<p>&quot;Computational thinking&quot; is an alternative learning process for formulating and
solving engineering problems. A unique set of abstractions are available to the
learner in addition to those from mathematical and written language. We have
developed an interactive textbook and problem sets using the Jupyter system of

facilitate solving problems with computational thinking.</p>

      <p>Little engineering goes into the design and
construction of ski and snowboard jumps in terrain parks at
publicly accessible ski resorts. Catastrophic injuries and
even deaths occur during skiing and snowboarding at these
resorts. It is possible to design the landing surfaces of
jumps such that the normal impact velocity on landing is
capped at a safer value regardless of the jumper's takeoff
speed and jump launch speed. These jump designs can still
provide large maximum heights and flight durations for
participant fun. We have designed a web application that
laypeople can use to design and analyze ski jumps with
specified equivalent fall height in mind.</p>

      <p>Mechanical and civil engineers utilize two- and
three-dimensional theories of stress and strain to determine
if structural beams will fail. Simple mathematical models
can be used to make accurate predictions of failure due to
shear, bending, and torsion stresses and due to deflection.
Solving beam related problems typically involves integrating
discontinuous functions and solving for boundary conditions.
The integral calculus and algebra details often hide the
trees for the woods. This project is centered around
developing a package for SymPy that can be used to model and
solve analytical beam problems, without getting bogged down
in the mathematical details.</p>
